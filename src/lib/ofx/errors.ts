/** Failure to *read the bytes* of an `.ofx` from disk — distinct from "the
 *  bytes are not valid OFX".
 *
 *  The distinction matters because the two have opposite consequences in a
 *  watched folder: invalid content is permanent (the file is marked `invalid`
 *  and never notified again), while failing to read is transient — an iCloud
 *  placeholder evicted back to a stub, a file moved between the scan and the
 *  read, permission denied. Treating the second as the first would bury the
 *  statement forever, since the key is the content hash.
 *
 *  Lives in its own module (not `load.ts`) so tests mocking `$lib/ofx/load`
 *  still compare against the real class.
