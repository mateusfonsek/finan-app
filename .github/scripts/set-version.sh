# to discard those — a loose search would false-positive precisely when `$v`
# happened to match some dependency's version.
#
# But we do NOT use `-x` (whole line exact): the real perl above only swaps the
# quoted value, so a trailing comment (`version = "0.2.0"  # bumped by CI`),
# leftover whitespace or CRLF survive the substitution and would make the guard
# report failure on a swap that actually worked. `[[:space:]]*(#.*)?$` tolerates
