# Reads from STANDARD INPUT instead of calling `git` internally: that way the
# tests feed fixed text, with no need to build a fixture repository per case.
# The workflow is what runs `git log`, piping the two together.
#
# The input is ONE RECORD PER COMMIT, NUL-separated (\0) — not line-separated.
# A commit body is free text: a pasted changelog line, a "fix: revisit later"
# bullet, or any lowercase label followed by a colon in the middle of the body
# matches the header regex if we read line by line without splitting per commit
# first. With NUL, each `read` takes a whole commit; only the FIRST line of that
# block is treated as the header, and the rest is merely scanned for the
# BREAKING CHANGE marker. That is what guarantees a body never becomes a header
# — do not simplify this back to line-by-line, it is exactly the bug this split
# fixes.
